# Predictive-Analysis-on-Craigslist-Vehicles

## Project Highlights
1. Analyzed over 500,000 records for car sales with 25 variables using regression and classification models in SAS. Established meaningful relationships between car price and its attributes and made prediction models, useful to sellers, online pricing services and buyers.
2. Implemented regression models like Linear, multilinear, polynomial, logistic, multi-logistic and classification models like decision trees.

## Introduction & Scope
**Executive Summary:** The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a new car can be assured of the money they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales are on a global increase (Pal, Arora and Palakurthy, 2018). There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features. Even though there are websites that offer this service, their prediction method may not be the best. Besides, different models and systems may contribute to predicting power for a used car’s actual market value. It is important to know their actual market value while both buying and
selling. Therefore, to determine the appropriate value(price) we have used the craigslist's vehicle dataset. The dataset set contains car values from 1900s to 2021. This dataset was cleaned, pre-processed, and several predictive models were runned out of which polynomial
regression was found to be the best one with a 69.98% R2 score.

**Prospective Clients of Price Prediction Model:** To be able to predict used cars market value can help both buyers and sellers.
1. Used car sellers (dealers): They are one of the biggest target groups that can be interested in the results of this study. If used car sellers better understand what makes a car desirable, what the important features are for a used car, then they may consider this knowledge and offer a
better service.
2. Online pricing services: There are websites that offer an estimated value of a car. They may have a good prediction model. However, having a second model may help them to give a better prediction to their users. Therefore, the model developed in this study may help online web services that tells a used car’s market value.
3. Individuals: There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less than its market value.

**Model Building:** We will be running following models in this project:
1. Multi - Logit Regression
  * Significance of Model & Variables
  * Prediction Model Equations
  * Business Inferences
2. Linear Regression
  * Multiple linear regression with all variables
  * Linear Regression with Lasso penalty
  * Linear Regression with Elastic net
  * Linear Regression with Forward selection
  * Linear Regression with Backward selection
  * Linear Regression with Stepwise selection
3. Polynomial regression
  * Stepwise Selection
4. Regression Trees
5. Logistic Regression : To predict the category of Used cars
